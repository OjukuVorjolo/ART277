<h1>Travelling in Depression</h1>
<P>When I was very little, I caught the travel bug. It started after my grandparents first brought <br>
    me to their home in France and I have now been to twenty-nine different countries. Each has <br>
    given me a unique learning experience.

        heart of Piazza San Marco feeding hordes of pigeons, then glided down Venetian waterways <br>
        on sleek gondolas. At thirteen, I saw the ancient, megalithic structure of Stonehenge and</P>

pronunciation. I remember once asking a store owner in Paris
where Rue des Pyramides was. But when I pronounced it
PYR–a–mides instead of pyr–A–mides, with more accent on
the A, she looked at me bewildered. 

<br><br>In the eighth grade, I became fascinated with Spanish and
aware of its similarities with English through cognates.
Baseball in Spanish, for example, is béisbol, which looks
different but sounds nearly the same. This was incredible to</p>

    <p>Then, in high school, I developed an enthusiasm for Chinese. As I studied Chinese at my
        school, I marveled how if just one stroke was missing from a character, the meaning is lost. I
        loved how long words were formed by combining simpler characters, so Huǒ (火) meaning
        fire and Shān (山) meaning mountain can be joined to create Huǒshān (火山), which means
        volcano. I love spending hours at a time practicing the characters and I can feel the beauty
        and rhythm as I form them.Then, in high school, I developed an enthusiasm for Chinese. As I studied Chinese at my
